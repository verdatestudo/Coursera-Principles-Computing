## Principles of Computing
<em>
This class consists of two parts that are five and four weeks long, respectively.<br />
Each portion covers a collection of principles that are fundamental to Computer Science.<br />
As a motivating application of these principles, we will examine a collection of strategy games and apply these principles in the analysis/solution of these games.<br />
Each week, you will watch a set of 6-8 videos and then complete homework on the mathematical aspects of these concepts.<br />
Your main weekly task is to complete a mini-project that furthers your practical understanding of the material.<br />
Both assignments have a soft deadline of Monday and a hard deadline of Thursday.<br />
An optional collection of practice activities is also available to further reinforce the concepts introduced in the videos.<br /></em>
