2048 is a simple grid-based numbers game. The rules of the game are described here.
In the first two assignments, we will implement a version of the 2048 game.
Although the original game is played on a 4Ã—4 grid, your version should be able to have an arbitrary height and width.
In this first assignment, we will focus on only one aspect of the game: merging tiles.
